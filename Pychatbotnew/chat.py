Natural Language Toolkit or NLTK is platform for building Python Programs to work with human language data

NLTK has a module,nltk.chat which simplifies building these engines by providing a generic framework

Chatbot using Python NLTK:
As you can see we have just hardcoded the probable question and answers in the listpairs.Lets interact more with Chatty :The nltk.chat chatbots work on the regex of keywords present in your question. So youcan add any number of questions in a proper format so that your chatbot doesnâ€™t getconfused in determining the regex

#lets make pairs of a text and a generic reply
