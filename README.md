# PyChatBot
Chatbot using Python NLTK : we have just hardcoded the probable question and answers in the listpairs.

Lets interact more with PyChatBot : The nltk.chat chatbots work on the regex of keywords present in your question. 

So you can add any number of questions in a proper format so that your chatbot doesnâ€™t get confused in determining the regex.
